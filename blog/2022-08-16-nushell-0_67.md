# Nushell 0.66

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your commandline. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful commandline pipelines.

Today, we're releasing version 0.67 of Nu. This is release includes a new variable naming convention, improvements to module imports and file sourcing, and more.

# Where to get it

Nu 0.67 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.67.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

If you want all the built-in goodies, you can install `cargo install nu --features=extra`.

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

# Themes of this release

## We have a new welcome banner ([fdncred](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/6163))

(screenshot here - figured this would be good at the front?)

## New variable naming convention ([jt](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/6125))

**WARNING! Breaking change!**

In this release, we cleaned up some of the syntax parsing.
The major implication of it is that variable names can no longer contain `-` characters in it.
Make sure to rename your variables from `kebab-case` to `snake_case`.
This is true also for variables created from command flags.
For example, a `--foo-bar` flag in a command signature will be referenced by a `$foo_bar` variable.

## Custom values defined in plugins?

It was a part of 0.66 already but we can mention it here once the docs are updated. https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/6070

## Relative paths in scripts are file-relative ([kubouch](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/6150))

When you use `source`, `use`, or `overlay add` with a relative path in a script or a module file, the path is assumed to be relative to the file, not the current working directory.

Example:
```
# script.nu

use foo.nu *  # foo.nu is assumed to be relative to script.nu
```

## Writing SQLite files

We added a fun way to create sqlite database files ([fdncred](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/6266))

Previously nushell was limited to reading sqlite database files. Now we allow you to take tables or lists and create database files like `ls | into sqlite my_ls.db`. Currently this functionality works with regular tables output from commands, table literals like `[[col1 col2]; [a b] [c d]]` and lists like `[one 10mib 20sec 2 2.5]`.
